# dotfiles

Apparently it's good practice to have configuration files -- 
so called dotfiles (because of the leading dot) -- 
under vesion control. 
And more important: on github, 
which makes it possible to easily clone it 
when one goes working on another machine. 

Note to self: put the folder under '~', 
then put soft links something like 'ln -s ~/dotfiles/* ~'  
into the home directory.
